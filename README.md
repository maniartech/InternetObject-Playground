# Internet Object Playground - WIP

Welcome to the Internet Object Playground! This interactive platform is designed to let you explore and experiment with the Internet Object (IO) format, a new-age, schema-first, tiny serialization alternative aimed at overcoming the limitations of JSON. Whether you're a developer, a data enthusiast, or just curious about data serialization, this playground offers a hands-on experience to understand and appreciate the capabilities of Internet Object.

## Features

- **Interactive Editor:** Experiment with IO syntax in real-time.
- **Schema Validation:** Test how IO schemas validate and structure data.
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Compare IO's efficiency against JSON and other formats.
- **Examples Library:** Access a variety of examples to learn common and advanced use cases.

## ðŸ”’ Security

This project follows strict security practices:

- **Daily**: Run `npm run audit` before commits
- **Weekly**: Run `npm run security:audit` for comprehensive checks
- **Automated**: GitHub Actions and Dependabot for continuous monitoring

### Quick Security Commands
```bash
# Check for vulnerabilities
npm run audit

# Fix auto-resolvable issues
npm run audit:fix

# Comprehensive security audit
npm run security:audit

# Check outdated dependencies
npm run deps:check
```

For detailed security guidelines, see [SECURITY-AUDIT.md](./SECURITY-AUDIT.md) or [SECURITY-QUICK-REF.md](./SECURITY-QUICK-REF.md) for quick reference.
