# Internet Object Playground - WIP

Welcome to the Internet Object Playground! This interactive platform is designed to let you explore and experiment with the Internet Object (IO) format, a new-age, schema-first, tiny serialization alternative aimed at overcoming the limitations of JSON. Whether you're a developer, a data enthusiast, or just curious about data serialization, this playground offers a hands-on experience to understand and appreciate the capabilities of Internet Object.
